        <h1>About</h1>
        <p><b>S2 Sports</b> was founded by Spencer Vincent. His vision was to create a place for athletes of all abilities to have access to top-of-the-line equipment. Vincent continues to research and expand his company to be used by athletes of all sports. </p>
        <p>Here is what sportadvisory.com had to say about the benefits of an indoor sports facility:</p>
        <blockquote cite="https://sportadvisory.com/indoor-sports-facilities-benefits/">Playing or practicing in extremely hot or cold weather is more difficult than playing or practicing in a controlled climate. This true for players, coaches, and fans alike. Games and practices wonâ€™t get canceled due to rain or snow as often when your practice is in an indoor facility. Some sports are difficult to have indoors. Baseball, for instance, is a sport that is rarely played indoors. However, coaches and players still value a facility where they can come practice indoors and not have to deal with the elements.</blockquote>
